## Hey, I'm CW 👋

Not much to share here.

Some non-unique things I enjoy:
- drinking coffee; I've been using an Aeropress since 2019
- writing Clojure code; not professionally (yet)
- bouldering; this happens to prove my creds more than my actual uni degree..

You know where to reach me!

*Talk to you soon!* ✌️
